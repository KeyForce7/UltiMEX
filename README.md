Hold Up on the ground to spawn Smallest Shield bubble “Stance”, bubble builds over time (opposite of normal shield that starts full and shrinks) / Up Stance + Up = Up Taunt, + Side = Side Taunt, + Down = Down Taunt / 

EXTRACT: Hold “Stance” for 2 seconds to charge EXtract meter, which will be full when the Sheild bubble is at it's biggest (about 2 seconds charge time) / If hit before 1 second of Stance charge has elapsed - the shield has barely grown - the shield will take impact and reset the timer / If hit after 1 second of Stance charge has elapsed but before 2 seconds have - the shield is halfway full - then you'll only have 1 second of EXtract meter / 

reak animation appears upon contacting foe / Any 1 Special instantly full charged (ie. instant Falcon Punch) / Any 1 Up Tilt, Smatk, Throw - “Launch” (ie. Dead or Alive) / Any 1 Side Tilt, Smatk, Throw - “Reverse Bounce” (ie. wall bounce) / Any 1 Down Tilt, Smatk, Throw - “Dizzy Stuns" foe (ie. shielding too long)
