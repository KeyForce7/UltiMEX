EXTRACT: Hold up to enter the "Stance" state, spawning the shield bubble effect starting as the smallest bubble and building over time (opposite of normal shield bubble that starts full and shrinks) / Hold Stance for 7 seconds to charge EXtract meter, each second representing a bar of meter availble (like a FG) which will be full to 7 bars when the Sheild bubble is at it's biggest (about 2 seconds charge time) / If hit before 1 second of Stance charge has elapsed - the shield has barely grown - the shield will take impact and reset the timer / If hit after 1 second of Stance charge has elapsed but before 2 seconds have - the shield is a bit full - then you'll only have 1 bar of EXtract meter / After 2 seconds of Stance but before 3 you only have 2 bars of EXtract and so on / Stance with no EXtract + Directions = Taunts (Up+Up, Up+ Side, Up+ Down) / Stance with any bars of EXtract + Directions = Teleports "Warp" (Up, Down for in place juke, side for left or right) 1 Warp = 1 bar of EXtract charge / While on full EXtract (7 bars): Any 1 Special is instantly full charged (ie. instant Falcon Punch); 1 Up Tilt, Smatk, or Throw “Launches” the foe (ie. Dead or Alive); 1 Side Tilt, Smatk, or Throw - “Reverse Bounces” the foe (ie. a wall bounce in a FG); and 1 Down Tilt, Smatk, or Throw - “Dizzy Stuns" the foe (such as what normally happens with a shield break, which ofc would never happen with infinite block)
